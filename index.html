	  <aside class='fragment'>Unlike this guy, with a last-generation tablet he's not having fun at all. I have been teaching for 32 years (plus gigs) and I've gone through all phases, from CS101 to master-level classes. I've seen what students have learned, and what they have not learned. And also put in practice what I preach, mainly in graduate-level cloud computing classes.</aside>

void main( int argc, char argv[] ) {
  printf("%s\n","Hello, world");
}

	    <img src='img/raku+irb.png' alt='Arrays and getting to them in Raku or Ruby'>
	    <aside class='notes'>Concept is the same, "composed" or "serial" thing. Its precisa meaning might vary (for instance, immutable or not?) but the pattern is exactly the same.</aside>

	<section><h1>Many over one</h1>
	  <img src='img/map.png' alt='Map in Raku and Haskell'>
	  <aside class='notes'>any languages over one language, many paradigms over one paradigm. This is object-oriented and functional. Underlying concepts are different, but it's clearly a map, an important concept. Additionally, another important concept here: lambdas, which are very modern and don't have an unified syntax, but still an important concept to learn.</aside>

	  <h1>Practical over theoretical.</h1>
	  <aside class='notes'>What is a map? You can explain to hell and beyond what it's about, and still not understand it until you put it to work in practice. When should you use a map, when a loop? </aside>

	<section>
	  <h1>MVP over "exercises", "written exams" and "problems".
	  </h1>
	  <aside class='notes'>It's admittedly difficult to create a minimally viable "product" if all you have are literals, but well, literals can be complicated too. Lambdas are literal, for instance.</aside>

	<section>
	  <h1>Understand and overcome errors over avoid errors.</h1>
	  <img src='img/error.png'>
	  <aside class='notes'>When you work with different languages, it's unavoidable that errors show up. You need to look at them, and interpret them, to find what's wrong with the syntax. Errors feel literally wrong, but also they make people feel bad, because they thing they're stupid and are not following instructions correctly. Errors are simply part of the learning process. This image is quite usual in my cloud computing class. When something is wrong, students are not used to look at the error, interpret it and make it right; they simply think they don't know how to do something. That's bad, and wrong, and is a hurdle for learning. </aside>

	<section><h1>Evaluation-as-code review</h1>
<h2 class='fragment' >Â» evaluation-as-grading. </h2>
<aside class='notes'>You are writing code, it should be evaluated the way it normally is. Use automatic or manual code review tools to check out the code the student has written. When teaching, every chance has to be leveraged for the learning process. using code reviews to help student learn something is similar to a enterprise programming process, but also makes learning easier. </aside>

	  <aside class='notes'>Not every one has the capacity to choose what they can do, or how they can teach or learn. But if you have the chance to design onboarding session, university classes, or online courses, opt out of "Do Â«this field in programmingÂ» in X". When anyone asks "What is the best language to learn, or do, X?" It's the wrong question, and the only right answer is every one of them.</aside>
